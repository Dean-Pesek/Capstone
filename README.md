This project will be a combination of three applications to create a whole clinic experience. 

Admin: 
  Where you will create and update patients data, doctor data, and appointment data.

Check-in: 
  Where the patient will check themselves in for their appointment, or the clinic staff will check in the patient for them.

Board:
  Where medical staff will take a checked-in patient's appointment and attach it to a room. 
  
The front-end will be made in React.
There is also a mobile client made in React Native.
There will be Springboot that manages database interaction.

Stretch: Hosting on AWS for deployment.
